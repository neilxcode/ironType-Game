# IronType-Game
This project is a game made with pure JavaScript, using canvas. Top-Down slash/shooter game.

## Development
Simply opening the index.html file will load this game, canvas is all front-end and requires no additional services.

## Build
This build is almost entirely in the game.js file, with images in an img folder and minimal HTML/CSS just to display the canvas.

## Unit Testing
Given the nature of this game application, testing is included in that any sprite that is not loaded for use will not allow the continuation of the game loop. Addition logs will be added when more features are implemented.
